I felt since she made that effort we would take it back to our room,1
Super nice family owned place,2
The pizza was super fresh and the salads were amazing,2
The owner was appreciative for our business and gave our boys a bottle of Sprite,2
Please support this business,2
Pizza was average tasting but it was very soggy to the point that if you tried to pick up a piece it would fall apart,0
Wings were not good at all and they were undercooked,0
I would not go back to this place,0
I 'm impressed by the concept these guys r bringing to the table,1
The pizza crust it nice and crispy,2
The pizza sauce is different in a good way,2
the texture reminded me of a marinara,2
I dug it,1
plus you can tell it was very fresh,2
Good for these guys,2
always nice to find a place making good food they believe in,2
keep up the good work,2
we will be back,2
Second time having pizza here and it was Sooooo good,2
All ingredients are fresh,2
crust is cooked perfectly & love that the pizza is n't super greasy,2
also the staff & owner are very friendly which is the cherry on top,2
This is definitely our new pizza spot,2
So after seeing the commercials and the text for a free slice a pizza,2
my friend and I decided to try them out since we were over that way,1
We walked in and told him we were there to get the promotional `` free '' slice,1
The young man then turned to the refrigerator and took out a pan of pizza with 2 slices and we asked was that the pizza he was about to give us,1
And he replied yes it was from earlier this morning,1
UMMM needless to say we walked out and didnt even want the free slice of cold refrigerated pizza he was about to reheat,1
First impressions are lasting and based off this we wont be going back to try anything,1
So I heard how good the food is here after the new management took over and all I can say is YES,2
I drove 40 mins across town during peak traffic hours to get this pizza and it was worth every minute I spent cursing at other drivers,2
THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY,2
They make it right in front of you and the guys are funny as hell,2
They get all the stars,2
Go to high roller every other day,2
Double down pizza is simply the best pizza in Las Vegas,2
Such a home made taste with so many toppings,2
I recommend this place,2
It 's awesome and the workers are cool,2
I just ordered from here for the first time tonight and I had the BEST experience,2
I spoke with Jarvis on the phone and he helped me with my order,1
they were out of the cheese I wanted so he made some other suggestions and they were AWESOME,2
He ended up delivering it himself and he just had outstanding customer service and I was SOOOO PLEASED with how the pizza turned out,2
I got the GLUTEN FREE crust loaded w veggies and I am in heaven right now,2
I def found my new delivery spot,2
Thank you,1
This was my first time going to the high roller,2
I had an amazing experience,2
Very friendly staff with amazing pizza at a very affordable price,2
The high roller specialty pizza was excellent,2
This was my first time there and I am already looking forward to my next,2
Super friendly staff,2
Gave great recommendation,2
We got the double down pizza and it was so good,2
If you 're passing by definitely stop by and check it out,2
Good luck,1
whomever bought this,1
drove an apparent good pizza place into the ground,2
My guess is that high roller story of winnings making the pizza,2
probably turned out to be a story of a loss of those winnings and had to sell,1
Do n't waste your time or money,2
What a shame,0
Amazing first time experience..customer service,2
quality AND taste,2
We called in to order but was n't ready when we arrived,0
We hung out inside and just talked stories with the workers,1
Felt so personal able and comfortable,2
Then we got our food,2
took it home and fell in love,2
We got the buffalo wings and the straight veggie pizza,2
OMGG reading the description of the straight veggie got me to order,2
but eating it now got me hooked,2
I LOVEDDD how thin the crust was,2
that all the veggies on it felt fresh and duhh how it tasted,2
Then the buffalo wings were just..perfect,2
The sauce was to die for..hot but not too hot but tasted hot,2
Haha it was a must order next time,2
Left overs here we come,1
I called in my order to ensure it would be correct,2
so you can imagine how disappointed I was that it was not,1
1/2 Philly 1/2 pepperoni,1
sausage,1
green peppers,1
opinions & olives with EXTRA regular sauce,2
We were hard pressed to see any sauce,2
I called & spoke to the same gentleman that took my order,1
He said he made it & guaranteed it had sauce & told me to look in the middle for it,2
Said he did n't hear me say extra sauce,1
although he had repeated it to me during the process,1
No offer to make good next time,1
Just an explanation that I was wrong,1
For $ 30 I would expect more toppings or at least recommend it to me,0
I would have paid,1
No good.. With all the great reviews here on Yelp I expected more.. Overpriced subpar pizza,0
Pictures of pizzas look better than they taste,0
Stopped in with my family and it was overall good,2
but a bit pricey for what we got,0
Pizza is ok,1
may come back,1
Great pizza great service,2
The driver forgot my soda and instead of just telling me sorry he went to the local store and bought me a soda and brought it back,1
So sweet plus the manager ( I 'm guessing ) offered a free pizza if he did n't get the soda in time just all around amazing service and amazing pizza,2
I will deff b a long time customer,2
We had it once,2
and that 's plenty,2
Super thin crust,1
I saw no sign of sauce,1
10 $ delivery charge,1
It was a let down,1
This place is no longer organic and is under new ownership/management,0
The staff used to be so welcoming and the new people are rude,0
They wo n't accept the restaurant.com certificates purchased under the old ownership ... I was told to call restaurant.com for a refund,1
The cleanliness has also gone downhill- kitchen was filthy,2
Tonight was my first time ordering from High Roller Pizza,1
Very impressed with the staff and the service,2
The pizza was heavenly,2
They use organic,2
free-range,2
non GMO ingredients,0
The crust is thin and crispy and the ingredients are all fresh,2
They also use real cheese,2
They just gained themselves a new customer,2
Welcome to the neighborhood High Roller Pizza,1
Brought my girlfriend here and got a heart shaped pizza courtesy of letting them know that I was coming in for a date night,1
The staff was awesome and we got a chance to banter back and forth while we waited for our pizza,2
We got an incredible pizza with a crispy crust and sauce that 's out of this world,2
If you get a chance,1
stop by here and grab some pizza,1
Meeeega dope pizza,2
Perfect crust,2
super tasty pizza,2
we got down on six pizzas at Artifice the other night,1
2nd time ordering from,2
Not impressed limited flavor dry pizza,0
Tonight ordered a Gryo,1
Do n't ever do that,1
Little meat sauce horrible and stale pita bread,0
I really want to love this spot,2
But,1
unfortunately,0
they just keep missing the mark,0
They recently lowered their prices,2
finally,1
so I ordered a ton of food on mypizza.com ... I then get a call that it 's 2 and a 1/2 hours for delivery,1
Cancel,1
I 've enjoyed their pizza in the past,0
but as a business,1
they need to really up their game,0
You 'll make a lot more business with those new prices,2
but you got ta be prepared to keep up with the demand,1
3 stars for the food ... When I actually get it,1
I went with another local joint tonight,1
First time here and love it,2
Got the pepperoni pizza and was awesome,2
the sauce was very flavorful and the thin crust cooked perfect,2
I will be back,2
Wow the change that was made by Jarvis at high roller pizza,2
They bettered the pizza here by far,2
If you have the chance to eat here do it,2
I will definitely be back for more,2
I ordered here on ubereats,1
Pizza was really nasty and undercooked,0
I got onion and green peppers for toppings and it was basically like raw when I bit into it,0
I did n't even finish eating it,2
The fries were just store bought frozen fries baked in the oven,0
Very blah,1
I would never order from here again and I 'm not even a picky eater,0
This used to be a GREAT pizza place,2
all natural and organic ... .NO LONGER ORGANIC OR NATURAL,0
They are under new management/ownership and it is a disaster,0
I called in an order last night,1
the guy asked for my address at least 3 times and then started talking to someone else instead of listening to me,0
so I had to keep starting over,1
After about 45 minutes I get a call from a guy asking me if I ordered pizza,1
I said yes I ordered two,1
He asked me for my address because the original guy who asked me for my address several times got the street wrong,1
I told this guy and he said he would be right here,1
When he arrived he asked me how I heard about this place and I told him we have ordered from here several times,1
His response was wow,1
I never delivered here before,1
The pizza 's did not look like the picture on the front page here,0
the ingredients were all over the box,1
Now I find out they are NO LONGER using Natural & Organic ingredients,0
Last time we will EVER order from this place,0
I can not say they are even like all the rest now,0
they are worse,0
Sad to see the original owner gone,0
she ran a classy place,2
cared about the customers and tried to make sure everyone had an enjoyable experience,2
I 'm not usually one to write reviews but this was necessary,1
We had decided to order High Roller for delivery from the good reviews,1
Upon receiving our order,1
noticed that the driver was careless and half of the ingredients were on one side of the pizza,1
To top it off,1
the entire large pie was UNCUT,0
How do you even manage to forget that,0
If you 're concerned about a timely delivery,1
at least pay attention to your quality and how you pack the pizza into the car as well,0
Went in and grabbed the `` snake eyes '' pizza today,1
Best pepperoni I 've ever had,2
Super cool place,2
I 'll be back to see Anthony and Sherri again,2
great costumer service,2
Another thing that stands out from most pizza places is all of the organic toppings and ingredients,2
And you can taste and feel the difference,1
If you 're looking for some quality pizza head over to High Roller,2
Estaba de vacaciones en Las Vegas Nevada,1
yo vivo en San Francisco ca,1
cansada de caminar buscamos una pizza ya que teníamos ambre,1
nos contesto un Sr. nos tomo nuestra información y dijo que nos llamaría,1
y jamás nos llamo y la pizza nunca llego,1
por lo menos hubiera dicho que no la mandaría,1
para pedirla a otra pizzería,1
Sunday July 12th we ordered a large pepperoni,1
artichoke,1
mushroom pizza 1/2 basil 1/2 jalapeño,1
however,1
when the pizza was delivered at Worldmark by Wyndham S Las Vegas Blvd we received a large pepperoni,1
We immediately contacted the restaurant back and was told by Hunter that he was going to contact the driver,1
We waited 20 minutes and called back to find that our pizza was being remade because of the error,1
That was at 10:30,1
We knew that you closed at 11:00,1
but,1
thought that in good faith we could get our pizza,2
When it was n't delivered by 11:00 we called back and of course the shop was closed,1
We paid $ 45 cash for a large 4 topping pizza and received a 1 topping pizza,1
We waited to get a pizza,1
never received it and had to eat a cold pizza,0
This is an unfortunate event and it 's even more unfortunate that you have employees working for the company that are n't true to their word and do n't care about customer service,0
I 'm giving a 1 star rating due to the customer service,0
I Ca n't comment on the pizza due to it being cold and not what we ordered,0
Very low quality pizza and ingredients,0
The crust is too thin,0
and it makes the pizza turn cold minutes after opening it,0
Just overall low quality,0
cheap food,0
Really good prices tho,2
I would not recommend,0
I love pizza but not theirs ... which is too bad because it 's very close to my house,0
The sauce was mediocre,1
at best,2
and somehow they managed to burn the crust,0
I wo n't be returning,0
Under new management not the same place Food took a while to get here,0
had to repeat my self a lot with the guy over the phone he was n't listening Pizza is n't the way it was described on coupon online,0
Menu on yelp is old owners they do n't have the same items,0
The 45 minute drive was well worth it,2
The food was f-ing amazing,2
the guys are f-ing hilarious,2
