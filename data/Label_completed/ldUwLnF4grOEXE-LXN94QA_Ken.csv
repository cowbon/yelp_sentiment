Service was good,2
Food was good,2
Just take note that some dishes are big enough to share,2
I want to love this place,2
Why do n't I,0
They have a number of vegetarian meals which is great ... except they are n't vegetarian,2
The potatoes and rice are cooked in meat broth,2
I asked if they had vegetarian potatoes and rice for the vegetarian meals and they said no,0
then told me I could get fries and mixed veggies instead,2
That 's all well and good but if it 's advertised as a vegetarian meal and comes with potatoes and rice cooked in animal broth,0
it is n't vegetarian,0
I 've also had a couple of waiters say `` oh you 're a STRICT vegetarian '',0
No,0
I 'm just a vegetarian,1
This is false advertising and not only that,0
it 's dangerous to a person that does n't tolerate meat,0
They need to be clear on their menus that none of their meals are vegetarian,0
Having said all that,1
the Greek salad is my absolute favourite,2
the tyropita were fantastic,2
the various dips ( tzatziki,1
hummus ) are excellent,2
The mixed veggies they serve as an alternative to potatoes/rice are not very good but the fries were terrific,2
I will go back again but I 'm not happy with them calling their food something it is n't,0
Came here one night with a friend who lived in the area,1
Had n't seen him in a while because I live in the States now so we decided to hit up some Greek food before getting downright drunk,1
Stopped off at a couple Greek restaurants in the area but were told that the wait would be at least 30 minutes so we put our names down but kept looking,1
Kalyvia seated us in 15 minutes so we stayed there even though they were completely packed,1
The lamb souvlaki is downright delicious,2
Have that with some pita bread and it is like taking a bit out of heaven,2
The lamb was very tender and not dry at all,2
At other Greek restaurants that I 've eaten at,1
there 's the chance that you 'll end up getting a hard dry piece of meat that is just disgusting,0
Well,1
Not here my friend,1
There are plenty of good Greek restaurants in the area but Kalyvia is one of the better,2
From a Greek ... food was great and service was good,2
Love the Greek feel and music playing,2
Authentic pork or chicken just like in Greece,2
Calamari was AMAZING,2
In the heart of Greek town Toronto,1
Our experience at Kalyvia was a lovely one,2
Beautiful evening weather,2
seats at one of the three tables on their cozy patio,1
yummy food,2
lots of white wine and a waiter keen to please and entertain,2
We arrived just as one of only three tables on the patio was leaving so managed to snag ourselves a seat at this prime real estate,1
It was perfect for watching the hustle and bustle of the Danforth rush by and soaking in the beautiful summer weather,2
Upon our waiter 's recommendation we went with ( see pictures ),1
Spanakopita,1
Little triangle of spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo pastry,1
The phyllo was light flaky and delicious,2
I prefer mine with a little more filling but they were still definitely tasty,2
The Pork Special,1
This was a huge portion,1
very tender and very tasty,2
Chicken Souvlaki ( the small size ),1
One skewer of chicken,1
tzatziki,1
roasted potatoes,1
and rice,1
It was tasty,2
tender and flavourful without being greasy,2
No veggies served with this dish,0
With every meal comes a complimentary salad which according to our waiter came complete with secret recipe house dressing ( pretty tasty and they 're definitely not skimpy with the feta cheese ),2
and toasted house bread,1
Beware the charismatic waiter,2
He 's funny,2
keen to please,2
proud as can be of his little restaurant,2
and ... a bit of a hustler,0
I 'm not entirely sure how it happened but we ended up with a second half litre of wine on our table without asking for it,1
Huh,1
Anyway,1
stop into this place if you 're on the Danforth,0
They make some great Greek food,2
