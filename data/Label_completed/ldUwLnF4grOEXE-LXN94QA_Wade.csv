No pretension,1
Normally I have late-night takeaway,2
but when I 've eaten in the service has been attentive but not overpowering,1
Best order,2
gyro platter,1
Food for a crowd and their gyro is juicy,0
flavourful,2
and comes with excellent salad and other fixings,2
The dolma and spanakopita are all made in-house and remind me of my grandmother 's recipes,2
Their lamb chops by the piece ca n't be beat,2
Do yourself a favour and order a bottle of old school Molson Dry with your gyro ( an in-house thing ) - you wo n't be disappointed,2
My favorite greek place on the Danforth,2
I love the gyros here for lunch,2
and the variety of dishes available for dinner makes it really hard to decide what to order,1
I 've never been disappointed,2
As the waiting line was so long at the Messini I decided to try my luck at Kalyvia based on Yelp reviews,1
I guess this restaurant could be good in other conditions,0

Almost 30 minutes to get served is a good reason to leave no tips,0
#NAME?,1
the food was quite good,2
the meat was tasty and the french fries very good,2
#NAME?,1
try to give like detailed bills with the name of the dishes next to the prices,1
it will be much easier for the customers,2
#NAME?,1
the staff is overwhelmed,2
Reading other reviews,1
it looks like we may have went at a bad time,0
We,1
and another table were the only ones there for a while,1
and yet the service was slow,0
Our Greek salads came,1
and it is safe to say that this was the worst salad I have ever had,0
I mean,1
how can you go wrong with a salad,2
There was SO MUCH dressing on it,2
it made the feta cheese all soupy and looked very unappetizing,0
Also,1
there was a lettuce head root in my salad which is just very unprofessional in any industrial setting,0
I got the Greek style spaghetti with cheese,1
which was just so bland,1
They did not even bother to put some pepper on it,0
The bass was drenched in oil,1
it was like soup,1
The rice was crunchy and under-cooked,0
there version of fries suck too,1
They were simply soft cold round potatoes,1
The halibut was very oily and the veggies were overcooked and had a weird taste,0
Moreover,1
there are many Greek alternatives in the area,1
that are amazing,2
I 'm a regular here,1
if only for the atmosphere and saganaki,1
Is it the best Greek food you can find on the Danforth,2
Probably not,1
Is it the cheapest,2
Absolutely not,0
Are the portions the size of your torso,1
Yes,1
which I personally view as a good thing,2
While Kalyvia may not be perfect,0
they are consistent,1
and they do make a mean Greek salad so how much more can you ask for,1
really,1
Great greek restaurant,2
My girlfriend 's family has been going there for close to 2 decades,1
The portions are quite large and their food is delicious,2
Their calamari is great,2
Saganaki is awesome,2
It 's very casual and has a homey vibe,2
Highly recommend,2
