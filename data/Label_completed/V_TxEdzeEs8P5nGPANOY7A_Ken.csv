To Sherri Ds `` compliment '' she sent me asking me did i even try the pizza,1
Um ... Did u read the review,1
Clearly I did n't and thats because your phone guy upselled me on a medium one topping,1
For miss sherri d to be an entrepreneur i guess she thinks its justified that her menu states one price but the price i was given over the phone was almost 10 $ more then what the menu states,1
The customer is always right ma'am,1
Maybe you havent been on your entrepreneur venture long enough to know that yet but i wouldnt give a dam if the pig or cow you get your meat from was made out of gold ... If your menu says one price and i call and hear something totally different im gna be put off by that,1
And your phone guy just thought i was going to go along with it and pay it,1
Instead of complaining to me about leaving a bad review you should be more focused on what u did to get it in the first place,1
Im a dancer in vegas and make a very comfortable living so it wasnt about the money it was the dishonesty in it,0
If i had looked at the menu and seen that price and it was consistent with what he said on the phone i would have ordered,1
So convincing me ur pizza is worth the 30 $ is not addressing the conflict at hand,0
Ur ignoring my issue to try n cover it up by saying everythings organic,0
I just went here with my boyfriend and customer service was horrible,0
The cashier was rude,0
did n't welcome us in just handed us a menu and asked `` what do you want '',0
We order a cheese pizza and some fries,1
The pizza was decent but the fries were n't even cooked they were super soggy and had no salt or seasoning,0
Not only were they not cooked but there was hair in them as well,0
The dining area itself is weird they only have two card tables in the very back and next to the tables the workers are just sitting there watching a movie,0
Very unprofessional,0
Maybe it 's the new management now but this place definitely went downhill,0
Well I tried this place since it was close to the hotel I was staying at,1
It was n't the most horrible pizza and chicken fingers I have ever had but pretty close to it,0
The fingers were thin and rubbery probably because they were cooked in a microwave and then covered with sauce,0
The pizza which was sliced in the box it was delivered in and that allowed the bottom of the box to fall apart tasted like the box,0
A cardboard flavored crust and the ingredients were minimal at best,2
I asked for extra onion and I think that it was one ring chopped into 6 pieces and placed as to where it would be cut,0
Not sure how the main page shows that they have 3 1/2 stars but I will not be recommending nor returning,1
For the cost I would have been better to go to a grocery store and nuked my own,0
The pizza was good,2
It 's nice to see a place like this open in Southern Highlands,2
The staff is very friendly and helpful,2
It was clean and plenty of seating,2
I would give this place a negative star if I could,0
Worst customer service ... Was trying to get 25 % discount and lady at the register said it was too late,0
Also other deals for special days on the menu but again no service to offer the upgrades,0
Too make matters worst no wings available,0
No sorry we are out,1
Manager is n't customer friendly either,0
Not worth the price of the pizza,0
Went in here for lunch yesterday to try it out since I am interested in eating at/supporting organic and non-gmo restaurants,1
Pizza was outstanding and fresh and fairly priced as well for quality ingredients like they are using,2
Two gentleman who were working there were also really good guys that were willing to talk about the quality of ingredients being used and gave the place an overall good vibe,1
Hope the owner expands over to green valley pkwy area as I think they would do well on this side of town by the track record of another organic spot near there,1
In future locations,1
my only recommendation would be to make it a bit more inviting to eat in as there were only a few small tables along the wall in this location,1
I will be bringing some more customers your way for sure,1
Keep up the good work,1
We have ordered several times but are disappointed with a pizza that looks like it was thrown against the wall and then boxed up,0
The person on the phone taking our order seemed delayed and had to repeat her questions,0
I called to report this and who ever I was directed to did n't seem apologetic,0
Needless to say,1
we wo n't be ordering from this pizza establishment any longer,0
The staff is hilarious and makes you feel welcomed,2
We 've been wanting to try this place for a while,1
The breadsticks are amazing,2
The pizza is really good as well,2
just wish they put a bigger portion of toppings on them,1
Definitely will be going back for more,2
Wow,1
What a pizza,2
We ordered the High Roller Pizza and a dozen of the pesto parm wings,1
with no regrets,2
On top of being all natural/organic ingredients and responsibly raised meats,1
golly it was delicious,2
Talk about a symphony of savory flavors,1
At least double the price of your run-of-the-mill pizza joint,1
but also double the quality,1
absolutely worth it for that once in a while,1
treat-yourself pizza night,1
We 'll be back,1
As I 'm new to the area figured I 'd give this place a try ... First thing when walking in there 's really no comfy setting to dine in,0
There 's a few high tables and chairs,1
Now that 's ok if it 's mainly a take out spot,1
My best friend and I a huge pizza and wing guys,1
So naturally we ordered a large pepperoni and order of wings,1
It was $ 40,1
For a 14inch pizza,1
12 wings,1
and to smaller bottle drinks ( no fountains ) and very limited beverage selection,0
Now so far I 'm still on the fence,1
While sitting waiting for the food we both noticed something called wing Wednesday,1
This was 6 free wings when spending over $ 30,1
Although this was not offered to us we mentioned it,1
The younger kid behind the counter actually said they do n't offer it because it 's not cost effective for the company and it must be requested at time of order,0
Are you kidding me,1
So now the food comes,1
It 's a very thin crust pizza which is ok,2
It 's no where near an authentic quality pizza,1
It 's ok,1
not the worse not the best just ok,1
The wings were absolutely horrid,0
Rubbery,0
baked,1
and no real sauce,0
Overall we were very disappointed with the customer service,0
the quality,1
atmosphere,1
and mainly the price,1
Very very over priced,0
So the reason for the one star is everything adding up and weighing out to that,1
We will not be back and wish this place all the luck,1
So overpriced,0
30 to 40 dollars a pizza and it was terrible Awful crust,0
we ordered pepperoni,1
Ghastly,2
Makes Pizza Hut look like gourmet pizza,1
Do n't waste your money here,0
I 'd like to start by saying this Enrique M. guy and his girlfriend were complete assholes,1
I was in the restaurant when his version of what happened went down,1
He did n't tell the whole story and he fudged the truth to make himself sound like the victim,1
I had a very enjoyable experience and my pizza was delicious,2
***My experience was ruined by that other customer and his nagging girl*** To ask to use your coupon AFTER the receipt has already been printed ... that 's YOUR fault buddy not the associates,0
Not only that,1
but the manager was more than willing to fix the price but dudes girlfriend had to be a complete snatch face and start going off over a few dollars,1
All I can say is,1
some people will never learn how to act like an adult,0
High Roller Pizza for ME,1
was great and I thank the staff for always being so nice,2
I love my High Roller pizza yesterday,2
I have friends staying at a time share on the strip,1
So got the large high roller and it was excellent I also got two salads great,2
I ordered for a 4,1
30 pick and I got there at 4:15 and my pizza was in the oven,1
Ready on time,1
Employees were nice and friendly,2
Very clean and smelt so good I ca n't wait to try the Greece pizza you wo n't be disappointed,2
Some of the best pizza I 've ever had in my life,2
My favorite is the Greek Roulette,2
I also love the Double Down,2
Pesto-alfredo sauce,1
chicken,1
asiago & mozzarella cheese ... amazing,2
They have many different specialty pizzas,2
subs,1
even wings.Lots of choices,1
- ) There 's definitely something for everybody here,2
After months of driving by this place every day,1
we finally ordered from them,1
Our only reluctance was the price,0
We gave it a shot today,1
and were happy that it was worth it,2
We had an organic place we used to order from in Cali,1
so it 's nice to have one out here,2
Good pizza,2
it 's the closest I have gotten to NYC pizza and I like the customer service,2
They are very friendly,2
If it were possible I would give this place no stars at all,0
Ok so first of all I chose to order from this place after seeing their very convincing advertisements,1
When we ordered the pizza we chose to have it delivered,1
not only was it the wrong pizza I do n't know if it 's spaghetti sauce they put on it or what but I could n't even finish one,0
I have a free pizza now because of the mistake and I am too afraid to use it,0
When the pizza arrived the driver pulled it out the heat bag turning them on it sides so the pizzas slid to one side and when we mentioned that to him he just gave me a blank stare and didnt even say sorry,1
The hot wings were the oldest and the hardest thing that i have tasted in a very long time,0
This is the second time ive ordered from them and will MAYBE give them one more shot but i will NEVER RECOMMENED them to anyone,0
This is my first time being at High Roller Pizza,1
The staff was very friendly and sociable,2
We could n't decide on what pizza to have because they all sounded great,2
So Chef Anthony asked us what we do n't like,1
So we told him what we did n't like and yet as a couple we can never agree on anything,1
So he decided to make us our own side of the pizza,1
Once we got the pizza it smelt AMAZING,2
We took the first bite it was a little bit hot in temperature so we let it cool down for couple minutes,1
Once it cool down we tried it again and it was delicious,2
You could taste every flavor from the barbecue sauce to the cheeses into the chicken,2
You can taste the freshness of each item,2
However after having a couple slices my mouth started to burn a little and that was from their barbecue sauce,1
I told Chef Anthony and he told me that they are working on fixing that spice level,1
That made me happy,2
Overall this is one of the greater pizza places in Las Vegas,2
Yes it may be on the more expensive side however you pay for what you get,0
By far one of the best pizza places in town,2
fresh ingredients,2
and great customer service,2
The people working there were really friendly,2
and the pizza is instantly one of my new favorites,2
I wish I could give them more than 5 stars,2
Definitely recommend this place to anyone who appreciates great pizza,2
When high roller pizza first opened up I was like hmmmmm and I gave them a shot as all the ingredients were fresh and it was just a great pizza all the way around but this pizza I had today was just horrible,2
According to the lady to who my order she said there is a change of management and they changed the pizza sauce and everything else but if you want my opinion that was a bad business move as this pizza is now at the bottom of my list.Too much competition out there and other places have better pizza like Grimaldis,0
Metro,1
Rosatis Pizza,1
and other places that have much better pizza,1
This is probably the worst pizza I 've ever had,0
I would never go here again,0
The wings were total garbage and tasted like rubber,0
The pizza crust was worse than a Boboli crust you buy at the grocery store,0
All around awful,0
The Mug Root Beer was good though,2
My girlfriend & I ordered delivery,1
we also used the $ 30 for $ 40 Yelp deal,1
We ordered a Large Texas BBQ chicken / Buffalo Chicken & Turkey Sandwich our food came in 45 mins,1
Hot & Yummy,2
I loved the Texas BBQ chicken it 's now my new addiction,2
) next time I will visit the restaurant & use my 25 % off Yelp Coupon,1
My family ordered this pizza while we were staying on vacation in Las Vegas,1
The delivery service to our hotel was great -- very easy and prompt,2
Overall,1
it is extremely delicious and high-quality,2
being made with organic and natural ingredients,2
I was happy with the normal veggie pizza,2
and my kids loved the ham pizza they got,2
However,1
we also ordered a buffalo chicken pizza for my husband,1
I have to say,1
it was the most ridiculously hot sauce we have ever eaten,0
I tried some,1
and it was tear-inducing,0
even with only two bites,1
My husband loves spicy food,1
and puts Tabasco on everything,1
While he way able to finish the pizza ( I never could have ),1
it became more of a `` Man vs. Food '' challenge,1
and was n't enjoyable at all,0
And the pain lasted two days,0
) Please exercise caution if ordering the buffalo wings or buffalo pizza,0
as the sauce goes way beyond pleasantly hot to painfully hot,0
This was by far some of the best pizza I 've had in a very long time,2
My pepperoni pizza was handmade and took a good 15-20 minutes to receive,1
but the wait was worth it,2
All ingredients were made extremely fresh and I left craving more,2
I used to think Domino 's had good quality,1
but this was definitely a step above,2
I only had one small gripe,1
there was no Pepsi available ( only diet ),1
but I figured I need to drink healthy anyway and got a water,1
The manager Anthony is very polite and takes pride in his ingredients and staff,2
Would come back again,2
Great quality pizza,2
My son is a pizza lover and was happy we tried this place,2
The sandwiches are delicious too and the staff super friendly,2
Will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas,2
Not good,0
( This pizza was very bland and the crust was way too thin,0
Sad to say I would not recommend this spot,0
The service was good both workers were very nice however the pizza just was not good,0
Warm and friendly service,2
Located on Las Vegas Boulevard but has a home town feel,2
Food was priced a buck or two higher than other pizza shops but the crust is addictive,1
Over all good experience,2
Pizza is not good I 'm sad to say,0
(,1
But nice staff,2
Owner on site very positive and pleasant,2
Always delicious,2
I have gluten allergies and they have always been cautious of cross contamination,1
Difficult at a pizzeria but this is one I trust,2
This afternoon we ordered a half sausage and half pepperoni pizza,1
The delivery actually arrived quickly ( just under a half hour ),2
paid the driver cash,1
