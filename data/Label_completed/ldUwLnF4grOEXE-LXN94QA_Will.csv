Definitely worth going back,2
Of late,1
I 've coming here more frequently as I have found their food much better than the other places in Greektown,2
Their menu has a wide selection and I 've found that my favourite grilled calamari is prepared significantly better than any of the other places around the area,2
Even something as simple as souvlaki,1
is done extremely well with portions that are very generous by my standards,2
Kalyvia is an OK pick on the Danforth,2
it has some Greek dishes that are tricky to find elsewhere nearby,2
( sigh ) I suggest ordering off the appetizers/mezes menu and sharing,2
The food is much more interesting than the boring mains ( souvlaki and rice,2
really people,1
Stop it,0
just stop ... ) We tried a combo platter which was a bargain for $ 16.95,0
just enough to feed two of us for lunch,2
It came with keftedekia ( greek meatballs ),1
marinated octopus slices,1
dolmades ( vineleaves stuffed with rice and beef ),1
2 mini spanokopitas,1
2 mini tiropitas ( cheese pies ),1
and greek sausage,1
The dolmades still tasted quite briny ( grrr,0
) but everything else was A-OK. Service was good,2
prompt but not overly friendly,0
Decor is n't as exciting or nice and some of the other places on the Danforth ( Ouzeri or Pan ) but Kalyvia has a more functional family dining type feel,2
Our first trip was today ans what a great experience,2
The venue was a very comfortable old world feel,2
but not dark as some of the ones along that strip can be,2
Our waiter was very good,2
but a tad full of himself and didnt give you a very warm fuzzy feeling with your visit,0
He was an older gent and has obviously been doing this a lifetime and has lost his capabilities to be warm and friendly,2
he is now just professional,2
too bad really,0
Our meal was fantastic,2
we started with the bread basket and greek salad,1
the bread is awesome,2
and salad is really good,2
loads of feta,1
Then onto the saginaki,1
They do flame this at the table for you,1
I enjoyed this very much,2
but my husband found it rather salty,0
The house wine was very good and not acidic,2
I had the chicken gyro dinner and my husband had the large pork souvlaki and both were awesome,2
The flavour of my gyros combined with the sauce,2
chicken,1
rice and pita was excellent,2
So all in all we very much enjoyed our visit,2
we may try another one of the locations just to test the waters and the serving staff,1
but I would and already have recommended this restaurant,2
I come to this page and am greeted by the suggestion to book a table ... I think not,1
Spent $ 40 on take out and my order is wrong and missing a main part of the meal,0
Not impressed,0
as this is the second time this has happened,1
They seal the take out bag like Fort Knox so there was no way to check without making my car smell like a kitchen,0
Not impressed and will only be returning for a refund of my meal,0
This is my second bad experience in as many weeks with take out on the Danforth,0
Having worked in the service industry for many years,1
I 'm not a fan of folks not doing their jobs ( kitchen to front of house ),0
If you 're 'above it all ',1
find work elsewhere,0
Great food and good service,2
I ordered the quail entree and my friend ordered the octopus,1
They come with salad,1
rice,1
roast potatoes and sauteed veges,1
All very good,2
Also if you buy the entertainment book it 's a buy one entree get one free so that 's a big plus,2
Been coming here for years also,1
But never done a review,0
The best dish is getting the souvlaki with some of the house wine,2
The tzatziki it comes with is meh,1
Over all I would recommend this place for families with older children,2
Full disclosure - I 'm a regular,1
and have been for about 3 years or so,1
It 's the best straight-up Greek the Danforth,2
Simple and delicious,2
