bring it in,1
Let 's get high,2
Roller,1
Pizza,1
Wait,1
no,0
That was the old restaurant,0
Once again,1
High Roller Pizza has new management ( as of 6/13/16 ) and this time it seems they 're dedicated to getting it right,2
The new official name is `` High Roller Pizzeria '' ( see what they did there,1
),1
the menu consists of many of the original specialty pizzas customers have come to love,2
and the staff is very friendly,2
But you 're here for the verdict on the pizza,1
Well,2
I 'm no Judge Judy but the jalape√±o/pineapple ( my fave ) that the chef whipped up was very satisfying,2
The ingredients were fresh and most importantly,2
the cheese was nice and gooey but not over the top,2
The pizza did n't have that nasty grease you get with $ 1 cheese slices in New York ( that you have to dab with a napkin ) but it did have a similarly thin crust,2
Not super thin,2
but not California-style crust,0
In between,1
It works,2
Had a slight buttery taste which I liked,2
This is the kind of pizza that is deceptively delicious,2
It seems like a lightweight Amir Khan pizza but a few slices in and you are officially a heavyweight/fat ass,2
There was a steady stream of customers coming in while I waited for my pizza,2
Surprising since this place was officially closed the past few weeks as the new management took over,1
Good location or branding,2
I guess,1
Or maybe people love the way the pizza tastes,2
I did oooooobviouslyyy,1
I also met the owners and they are hella cool,2
Yep,1
`` ... Hella,1
The pizza was amazing,2
the crust is so good,2
I order the high roller pizza and they definitely are n't skimpy on the toppings,2
Very delicious,2
This place could easily be 5 star,2
Guy behind the counter was great,2
I mean great,2
They were out of parmesan packs,1
so he proceeds to pull out a bag of fresh shredded parmesan and chop it and put into 2 containers,1
No charge,1
Pizza was good,2
not great,0
Would like it a little more crisp with some more cheese,2
but it was good,2
House salad was amazing,2
Super Fresh,2
outstanding croutons and very good portion for the price,2
My biggest complaint,2
the Ranch Dressing,1
it sucked,0
Need to give this another go guys,1
people are increasingly using Ranch on not only a salad ( my purpose ) but pizza and fries as well,1
Had to stop at another restaurant on the way home to pick up some quality Ranch to eat with my salad,1
I 'd say take out or delivery would be preferred,2
Not really an environment you 'd want to hang out and eat your pizza,0
Just a few tall tables,1
no music,0
no fountain drinks ( there are two coolers with bottled drinks to purchase ),0
After ordering our pizza and paying for it,1
we noticed the Monday special on the menu board to receive a free pizza with any 16 '' pizza purchase,1
We asked about it and the guy seemed annoyed that we even asked,0
We proceeded to ask if we can still have the special and he just shook his head and mumbled yeah,0
My husband tried conversations with him in a friendly manner and the guy gave short responses and never looked up at him,0
Less than good customer service,0
Not very friendly people working this day,0
Also,1
the floor in the public area is very dirty,0
Pepperoni pizza was a bit greasy ( like the pepperoni 's were filled with grease ) but it tasted great,2
No trash can to throw away our stuff,1
Definitely a place to pick up or delivery,1
Very awkward environment,0
As we left no one said thank you or goodbye until we said it as we were walking out the door,0
IF we ever feel like eating here again it will not be dine in,0
This place is phenomenal,2
They have a wide variety of thin crust pizzas on the menu,2
I definitely will frequent this place to try the variations as well as the sandwiches on the menu,2
Sounds like they are coming out with wings on the menu soon and I already circled the date on my calendar to be back for that,1
Originally from the bay area but I 've moved a LOT,1
So have tried pizza everywhere,1
I love my Las Vegas haunts and High Roller Pizza is one of them,2
Every time I go it 's a jackpot - excuse the pun,2
Really fresh,2
organic,1
you feel satisfied,2
not full,0
The smell is irresistable,2
Great job,2
guys,1
And I love that you deliver in Smart Cars,2
) Turned all my Vegas friends on to you and will continue to,2
The best pizza I 've ever eaten,2
The Four of a Kind ( cheese ) is delicious,2
Their new white pizza,1
the Lady Luck,1
is my new favorite,2
I 've not had anything at High Roller that I did n't love,2
I now eat far too much pizza,1
Horrible,0
horrible,0
horrible,0
Ordered a pizza from these clowns,0
after 2 hours it finally showed up,1
Cold as could be and they would n't do anything to rectify the situation,0
Finally,1
they offered a free pizza upon next order but would n't honor it next time we called ... will NEVER order from this joke of a pizza shop again,0
Pretty good pizza but a little too high of price,1
Will go back but do n't like the higher prices although the ingredients are higher quality,1
Who ever the new owners that took over this pizza place ruined a good pizza spot,0
I ordered a Hawaii pizza and there was barely any cheese,0
pineapple and ham,1
WAY too much sauce,0
I called back and their response was `` we make our pizzas with portion control ... The toppings and sauce are pre measured,1
'' Well whoever 's the mastermind behind this needs a new occupation,0
My first time to vegas,1
some of the best pizza I have had in a long time,2
They were very nice,2
the blonde long haired manager is so sweet,2
Definitely coming back everytime,2
The pizza was nice and crunchy,2
but I still feel like they could amp the sauce,1
I asked for extra,1
and I still do n't believe I got extra,0
Pizza was on the verge of dry but not as bad as others have said,0
However,1
the flavor of the ingredients in my pizza choice made up for the lack of sauce,0
The staff is cool ... And the place is close,1
Next time I go I will make sure to say extra extra sauce lol,1
The pizza is good but not great,1
The crust was a little burnt and the sauce was not real impressive,0
The pepperoni was a little spicy and good,2
Overall,1
we will probably not go out of our way to buy this pizza again,0
If I could give less stars I woud,0
Should have read yelp reviews first,1
Man this was by far the worse pizza I have ever tasted,0
The stoned people at the party even turned it down,1
There was so much sauce they could have made 4 pizzas those tiny Pepperoni 's did n't stand a chance,0
So sad because I would have been a returning customer but all jokes aside there were so many red flags not to order from here from the phone call to order pizza being placed on hold for 20 mins but could n't hang up because of a conversation I could hear because I really was n't placed onhold,0
Then the fact it took 1 hour to get the pizza,1
So sad that there is two whole pizzas left,0
I love High Roller Pizza,2
The owner and staff give excellent service and most importantly fresh,2
delicious,2
hot pizza,1
If you are tired of every day boring,1
run of the mill pizza,1
then go to High Roller Pizza,1
For their Grand Re-opening the are having a buy one get one free of equal or lesser value If you pick up ...,2
a great deal for families,2
or those not in the mood to cook and looking to have a party or entertain friends,1
Just had the Greek flush ... ..o.m.g ... to die for,2
They are open late ... 12:00pm.-2:00 a.m.Sunday -Thursday,0
and open 24 hours Friday - Saturday,1
The Pizza simply was not good,0
Got the Greek Flush pizza,1
Crust was bad and the pizza was bland,0
They delivered quickly though,2
Delicious pizza,2
Was ready at time promised and tasted GREAT,2
Appreciate the yummy and organic quality,2
Will be my `` go to '' pizza place in my neighborhood,2
Best Pizza,2
Good Price,2
Friendly Service,2
^_^ Fast Delivery,2
* Awesome * Very fresh pizza,2
I have to say every time I come into this shop I get the best service and CUSTOMER service,2
Anthony and Bri are always so nice and accommodating,2
The food tastes great and I enjoy watching them make it in front of me,2
Just moved to the area and tried to find a good local pizza place,1
This was not it,0
Ordered 2 medium of their specialty pizzas,1
got 2 smalls,1
but luckily was only charged for smalls,0
Okay,1
fine,1
But some of the toppings listed on the menu did not make it to the pizza,0
the crust was rubbery and flavorless,0
and I was generally unimpressed,0
Only made it to 2 stars because the hot wings were n't bad,0
$ 40+ for delivery with tip for 2 small pizzas and 10 wings,1
not at all worth the price,0
We ordered for the first time tonight,1
It was amazing,2
The Double Down pizza was fantastic,2
The BBQ wings were so tender the meat came off the bone so easy,2
The pulled piggy sub was off the charts,2
The staff was so friendly and helpful with ordering,2
His recommendations were spot on,2
Can not wait to try the meatball sub next,2
Thank you High Roller Pizza for making everything fresh and not salty,2
Good bye other pizza places we have found heaven in High Roller Pizza,2
Great place,2
great food,2
great service,2
No need to right a lengthy review and nit pick and disect a meal,1
by itself,1
i give 4 stars,2
but compared to other options nearby,1
in regards to portion and pricing,0
id drop it down to 3 stars,0
ordered a large pizza that was half greek roulette / half wild card,1
the greek half was full of flavors that blended well together,2
and the wild card half was definitely above and beyond your average pepperoni pie in terms of taste,2
I 'm not usually a fan of thin crust,1
or pizza cut into squares for that matter,1
but this was baked just right and overall a good pizza,2
again,1
my issue is with portion and price,0
i have no problem dropping $ 30 on a pie from Joes,1
but i walk out with a 19 inch pizza that wo n't even fit in my fridge,0
the 16 inch large pizza from HighRoller was a bit underwhelming ( for the price ),0
that 3 inches may not seem like much,1
but its actually a huge difference,1
*Using the surface area equation,1
A=Pi x R2 16 inch pizza 3.14x 8 x 8 =200.96 19 inch pizza 3.14 x 9.5 x 9.5 =283.38 i also ordered a philly sub,1
hands down delicious,2
grass fed beef has a gamey flavor that was complimented by the mushrooms and peppers,2
also mozzarella was a surprisingly good choice to round it out ( although there could have been more of it ),2
again,1
delicious,2
but we come back to portion and pricing,1
if a Capriottis sub had a premature baby ... the subs here would be it,1
i purchased the yelp deal that was worth $ 40,1
and in return i got a 16 inch pizza,1
a sub,1
and a 20oz soda,1
not sure the value is there,0
i realize the cost of organic/free range/non processed ingredients drive up the price,1
but it seems a bit too much ( or maybe I 'm just cheap ),0
company should consider providing a bit more info on the ingredients that demand these prices,1
people who seek out healthy food alternatives want more than just an organic or free range stamp ( like what state the veggies are grown in,1
or what farm the animals are from ),1
`` High Roller Pizza carefully handpicks and scrutinizes every single one of their ingredients '' yet offers very little detailed information to the customer,1
all that being said,1
ill certainly be back,1
its right down the street from me,1
and a great alternative to the chain pizza joints,2
Today they opened with new menu and new management,1
Highly recommend stopping by and trying out the pizza and wings,2
Ignore all the bad reviews over the last few months and give this place a try,2
3 choices of sauce and lots of toppings,1
It was nice to be able to watch the pizza get made and decide what we wanted on the pizza as it is being made,2
Our first pizza we ordered was a 16 '' Hawaiian pizza with the original sauce,1
The family loved the pizza and it was great to see the kids eat the crust ( most pizza places they throw away the crust ),2
