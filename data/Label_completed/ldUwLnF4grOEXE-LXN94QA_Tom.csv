We had supper there last night,1
We shared a bottle of white house wine ... it was good,2
Gord ordered Ortikia ( two large size quails mixed with herbs and spices baked in the oven ) with rice,1
potatoes and veggies,1
I ordered Chicken Breast Dinner ( two generous pieces of char-broiled chicken filet ) with rice,1
potatoes,1
veggies and tzatziki,1
It was delicious,2
My only complaint is that the veggies were n't fresh ( they were cooked from frozen ),0
I 'd recommend this restaurant ... the food was good and our server was very friendly,2
Been going there for years,1
Lately they have been dropping the ball,0
so from once a week I 've been going once every three months but still very inconsistent,0
Cooks which are the owners kin have become very complacent,2
Hey Hanna K. the salad dressing is olive oil,1
lemon juice,1
egg,1
salt,1
One of the first places I 've had Greek in Toronto since moving to Canada,1
The food is very good and the service is above average,2
I had the pork souvlaki dinner and found it to be cooked nicely and tasty,2
The greek salad they serve is different than what I 've had in the past,1
they use a different kind of dressing that tastes really nice,2
I recommend giving it a try,2
We lived in Riverdale for seven years and tried every Greek restaurant on the Dannie in that time,1
The only one we return to after many years away is Kalyvia,2
Ambience may not be warm but i go for the food,2
Nobody does chicken Souvlaki like these guys,1
Or the lamb or the moussaka or even the Greek salads and tzatziki,1
Yummm,2
Maybe I do n't like the taste of the Greek food but for me they are great,2
I love the customer service,2
5 stars for that,2
This is really 2.5 stars almost 3,2
Went during Taste of Danforth 2 wks ago,1
Since it was hot and crowded outside we decided to eat indoors,2
Food costs almost double as if you were to eat in the streets ( ie Feta fries $ 2 outside,0
$ 6 inside ),1
Gyros pita $ 5 vs $ 8 inside,1
I guess that 's what you pay for the seats,1
ac,1
service,1
The food was meh,0
I 've had much better greek food on Danforth,2
Portions were a bit on the small side and pricey,0
I ordered the 3 combo dip and it was almost like those small plastic containers you get for salad dressing and it came with a whole 1 in a half pita bread cut up,0
I had asked for more pita but he forgot about it but did n't forget to charged the $ 3 ( he did take it off after a bit explaining ),0
Service was so-so,1
although it was n't busy I did n't see my waiter much ( Mr. Vasili ),0
But I did see him have lunch on the table across from us,1
Do n't think I would go back,0
there 's much more Greek restos on Danforth to try,1
If your a fellow Montrealer and crave some good Greek food,1
Messini restaurant which is diagonally across is very similar to home and really good,2
They were packed with 3 rows of lines,1
Kalyvia is my favourite place to dine on the Danforth,2
My experience has always been comfortable,2
fun,2
clean and yummy,2
The big menu,1
quality,1
and portion of the food are very exciting,2
If you love gyros that is leaner and not dripping of oil everywhere,2
this is the place for you,1
I also love the staff there because they have such big bubbly personalities and care about giving you the best service possible,2
You can dine inside the restaurant which is very clean and has a beautiful cozy decor,2
or,1
you can dine on the patio and enjoy their delicious Greek dishes,2
all for reasonable prices,2
We decided to try something different today,1
The last time we found we were not impressed with the Greek food we at at Astoria so thought we would give this place a whirl,0
We started with saganki it was quite good,2
It had a nice bit of crunch and a good size,2
Like everyone else says the tzakiki is delish and the garlic bread tasted like the good old garlic bread we had before,2
My husband had the chicken breast dinner the chicken was good a little too much Dijon spice flavoring for my liking but it was good,2
I had the beef souvlaki and it was good,2
