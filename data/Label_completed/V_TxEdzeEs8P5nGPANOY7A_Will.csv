The second pizza was a 16 '' with organic sauce and pepperoni,1
italian sausage and spicy capicola,1
The sauce was GREAT,2
The entire pizza was great,2
I am looking forward to my next trip to try another combination of sauce and toppings,2
If I could rate less than one star I would,0
I placed an order online and I called three times to verify my order and the address after 2 hours they all of sudden does not have the order or address wth they are the worst,0
Absolutely delicious pizza and amazing service,2
This place is right down my house off the Boulevard,1
Got chicken wings and a large pepperoni pizza with jalapenos and roasted garlic the pizza was cooked perfectly the crust was nice and crispy everything was fresh and the man that delivered the Pizza was so sweet family owned place will be back,2
Love this place,2
After the fiasco at 800 degrees pizza ( flour everywhere but sells gluten free pizza,1
),1
High Roller pizza was a dream,2
I had a GF pepperoni and Mushroom and my husband had a Hawaiian pizza,1
Yum,2
The toppings were generous,2
the sauce is homemade and everything was delicious,2
I highly recommend this restaurant,2
Just moved to the neighborhood a week ago,1
This is the first pizza place that shows up on yelp with good reviews,2
I called to place an order for pickup,1
In my mind i had already decided on getting the build your own pizza medium sized which said 16.99 for medium and 2.50 for one meat which i wanted pepperoni,1
Basically one medium pepperoni pizza,1
I told him thats what i wanted and he tells me my total is 28 and some change,1
Huh,1
A medium basic pizza costing 30 $ when the menu says about 20 $ before tax,1
I asked him why is it so expensive when the menu clearly says about 20 $ and his response was so ridiculous,0
`` We sell all organic ingredients '' blah blah blah ...,1
Um well why is the rate different on your menu,1
He says the price is the same,1
Yea ok dude no thanks,0
I hang up,1
Seriously,1
Trying to over charge me and then explain that your pizza is organic like thats an excuse,0
I live a few miles away and would had been a loyal customer had they charged what they advertised and been more pleasant,2
Not going to rip me off though nice try and goodluck with your business,0
The pizza is very good,2
this place really did a good job on its receipts because I never have tasted any pizza like this on the west coast,2
I order as large pizza for delivery and I got it fresh and got in no time their pizza cost a little more but it 's worth it in my opinion,2
Had the cheese pizza once,1
It was ok. Just ok,1
But they wont do swap outs,0
For example,1
I do n't eat beef and I asked for the Philly sub with either chicken or turkey,1
Guy on the phone said he could n't do it,0
Alrighty then,1
Imagine a New York thin crust pizza that stays intact,2
Their thin crusts are baked crisp,2
so the ingredients stay together with each bite,2
The texas holdem pizza was rich in barbeque sauce and drowning in chicken and bacon,2
truly for a meat lover,2
The double down pizza had a mild pesto sauce that does not overwhelm the mushroom,2
tomato and meat in the pizza,1
The cooking time took a little longer than an average New York thin crust pizza due to the rich toppings,0
The workers were friendly and accomodating,2
For a foodie from OC,2
this organic pizza sure did hit the spot,2
There is no way the positive reviews below can be real,0
I gulped when a sandwich and a large pizza came out to over $ 50 with delivery,1
tip and tax,1
but I thought it might be something special,0
I really wanted to like this pizza,2
thinking healthy/organic ingredients would make for a delicious pizza,2
NOT SO,0
The cheese and sauce are very bland,0
I 've had better pizza at some of the bigger chain stores and that 's not a good thing,0
The crust was soggy and floppy,0
The pizza is cut like a checker board,0
making for awkward/messy eating,0
The Italian sandwich was just okay,1
but nothing I would recommend,0
The delivery girl was friendly,2
but was 30 minutes late according to the restaurant 's own delivery estimate,0
With so much competition,1
there 's no real reason to order from here,0
sorry,0
I feel ripped off for paying this much for so little,0
Favorite and BEST pizza in Las Vegas,2
This is thee ONLY place you can buy pizza and not get this gut bomb in your belly afterwards,2
This restaurant truly is going above and beyond with their ingridents and is something you can not only taste,2
but feel,1
The pizza is great,2
I had an opportunity to meet the owners and they were very aware of what was going on in the shop and always trying to make it better,2
excellent operators here,2
Thanks Sherri,2
Customer for life,1
Highly recommend,2
My buddy picked up a pizza and its way overpriced,0
Frozen pizza is much better,2
i dont think they actually use fresh organic vegetables me and my buddy agree its the worse pizza weve ever had,0
Wouldnt recommend to anyone,0
This place is under new managment/ownership,1
Two years ago when they first opened,1
we could not wait to be back in town to order from them and did many times,2
It 's now,1
no longer made with `` fresh '' homemade sauces,0
Its ... just cheep thin crust pizza,0
Unlike their name of `` High Roller '',1
It was and is the worst pizza,0
You can get better pizza at a small time,2
home fair,1
I can only give 3 stars this time ... I ordered pizza and wings for delivery,1
I wanted the High Roller with no olives,1
mushrooms on half and sausage on half,1
I CLEARLY asked several times to make sure the mushrooms and the sausage were not on the same side,1
Mushrooms on half and the half without mushrooms,1
sausage,1
He said he understood what I wanted,1
Well the pizza came and he failed me,0
The mushrooms and sausage were on the same side,1
very sad ...,0
The wings,1
first time having were pretty good and they are popular because they only had one order left,2
So we were half lucky tonight,2
I did call to let them know they did not get it right and the guy who made the pizza apologized,1
he said he asked for clarification from the guy who took the order and this is what he was told,1
He did apologize again but made no offer to fix the mistake,0
Oh well,1
next time it will have to be pickup to ensure we get the right pizza so everyone can enjoy it and no one has to be left out,0
Food was great,2
those who are enjoyed it,2
We will be back ...,2
I will never spend my money here again,0
It took over an hour for my delivery and I love less then 3 minutes away ... I ordered a club sandwich,0
chicken wings,1
and cheese bread ... not only was the hot food cold but I got an Italian sub ... when I called to complain I was told to call back,0
So I did,1
No longer all natural and organic,0
High Roller was an amazing pizza joint that was pricey but worth every penny,2
Now its just your average pizza place,1
I have to say,1
the guys who work here are FANFRICKINTASTICAL,0
The pizza just is n't my style,0
Part of me wishes it were because the guys who work there went way above and beyond,0
I ordered pizza on a Friday night,1
I asked them if they had Dr. Pepper and the guy said,1
`` Oh man,1
we do n't and it 's my ALL TIME FAV,0
'' When the delivery dude showed up at my door he had a special Dr. Pepper for me,1
Folks,1
they went to the store and got me Dr. Pepper,1
I gave him a $ 10 tip and said holy cow,0
best service ever,2
I felt like royalty,2
I might give them another shot solely based on the amazing customer service,2
Pizza was very good and the staff was great,2
They even delivered me and my pizza to my Rv park,2
I walked in,1
with the plan to order pizza,1
The cook was preparing a sandwich,1
so I ordered the Meatball sandwich for myself,1
I was ordering on the spot,1
so I asked for light sauce,1
extra cheese and buns toasted open,1
When I arrived home,1
my sandwich was not soggy and toasted to perfection,2
The young men that were working,1
we 're both very nice and we able to answer all of my questions,2
I give sandwich a and will be returning to try some of the pizzas too,2
I ordered a pizza on the website,1
Created a login with my Facebook,1
The order never came and we checked 4 times that it was in there,0
It cleared from my account about 10 minutes ago,1
I tried calling 3 times but nobody answered,0
The voicemail says that they are closed Christmas day ... .it 's middle of January,1
As soon as we walked in and informed we were there to pick up a pizza,1
it felt like we were not welcome,0
Like it was a burden that we came and asked for our order,0
We ordered online and we got a confirmation that said it would be ready for pick up at 7:01 but in reality when we got into the store at 7:05,1
the pizzas were not yet in the oven,0
We left at 7:25,1
Those were minor things compared to the apparent manager,0
maybe owner,1
berating his employee about putting sauce too close to the crust,0
Not a smart thing to do in front of your customers and probably not the way you want to treat your employees,0
Pizza was a 7/10,2
Wo n't be coming back,0
Hopefully this place changes the way it treats its customers and employees,0
My bf and I ate here for the first time today,1
and being that my bf is from New York,1
he was skeptical to try a pizza labeled as `` Vegas Style,0
'' but the advertisement of organic ingredients and a healthier meal lured us in,1
To our surprise,2
we were not disappointed at all,2
The food was really good and the staff was very friendly,2
We 'll definitely be back again,2
I FINALLY got to try this pizza.. I fly back and forth to Vegas every once in a while and I have multiple friends who eat this pizza.. Even though finding food in Vegas is not difficult- finding quality ingredients like the ones they use is not as commonplace in LV as it is in Oregon,1
I loved their gluten free crust,2
Will definitely be a repeat customer,2
Stayed in Vegas with some friends for Bachelor Party and had a quite a few hungry friends,1
They whipped 3 specialty Pizzas in no time,1
Good service,2
tasty thin crust pizzas were consumed very quickly,2
Would go back if Im ever in Vegas again,2
Now this is some good pizza,2
The fact that its organic and free range products is just a plus,2
The staff was super friendly and even made us a custom heart-shaped pizza pie for Valentine 's,2
The price was a bit up there but you absolutely get what you pay for ... And that 's quality,2
Happy Valentine 's day and thanx again High Roller Pizza for completing our special request,2
you 're the best,2
Yummy & tasty pizzas,2
Good prices and quality ingredients,2
Definitely would come her again,2
Under new ownership,1
This is the worst pizza I 've ever had,0
Disgusting,0
I 'm eating ramen noodles for dinner now,1
$ 40 for one pizza and 12 wings,1
Do not eat here,0
It is not as good as it was,0
We found this place on Yelp and they boast Organic Free Range Pizza,1
They make a thin crust which in itself is amazing however if you desire gluten free they have that as well,2
We ordered the High Roller which comes with a selection of meats & fresh veggies,1
We ordered it to go as they have limited seating inside & looks more like a pick up & go place,1
They do not serve any alcohol so if you like beer or something else with your pizza,1
this is the better option,2
The pizza was amazing,2
you could see the freshness of all the veggies while they were preparing the pizza,2
the sauce is house made which is one of the best sauces I have had in a long time,2
They also have a variety of subs & sandwiches,2
While we were there waiting for the pizza we saw the roasted tomatoes being prepared & cooked as well as the Philly Cheese Steak,1
All I have to say is if that is how they normally prepare the Philly,1
I found a new favorite place,2
Not just because it looked amazing going into the oven but it is Grass Fed Beef which makes this over the top,2
Some things I would like to try here,2
the wings which they were out of & the website shows that today,1
no wings or pulled pork,1
When you are going for quality & you are not willing to sacrifice your reputation to make money,2
this will happen & this place earns my HIGHEST recommendation for that & that alone,2
I would also like to try the Philly and the Meatball sub sometime,2
This is a good place & is close to home,2
so I will be calling in orders & bringing them home,2
They have great hours as well which makes them a great choice,2
You will not find a pizza place like this that refuses to sacrifice their values,2
I do not know the owner or anyone who works there personally,1
but they have my VOTE ... If you have not tried this place,2
seek them out & try them ...,2
Ordered a large pizza for delivery and I specifically asked for easy sauce and chicken and mushrooms on one side only where I was staying at the Cancun resort they only brought the pizza to the lobby and then had the lobby call and request to have me or my husband come down to pick up the pizza instead of them delivering it to the room when we receive the pizza the pizza was not as we ordered it was very dry heavy sauce and mushroom and chicken all over the pizza we called the guy explained to us that he would replace the pizza with the pizza that we had ordered in the first place half cheese and half chicken and mushroom so we received a call to my cell phone from the delivery guy who stated that he was about toDrive into the parking lot and for us to meet him in the parking lot to pick up the pizza that was replaced that weird just ordered yet again,0
needless to say I will never order from here again,0
Thank you for the great pizza and customer service we had a great pizza party with our family visiting and toped it off with a great wine to go with your gluten free pizza once again u guys out did urself thanks again from ur favorite customer at one Las Vegas Steven and Paula thanks u guys rock,2
I thought the ingredients were supposed to be top quality,1
and maybe they are,1
but they had no flavor,0
I had a tasteless gluten free veggie,0
The prices are almost doubled that of Pizza Hut,0
only thing is that Pizza Hut has more flavor,2
My family and I are passing through Vegas and found this place,1
We were hoping to sit down and relax but it 's more of a take out type of place,1
We were about to leave and the owner ran out and gave us a menu,1
